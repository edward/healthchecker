# Healthchecker

This app lets your team perform health checks with low friction:

1. Champion visits this app and obtains a unique URL for this health check session
2. Champions shares the URl with their team; team mates join the session and can see how many others have joined
3. Team fills out health check anonymously
4. Whenever ready, someone can hit a button to show an average or lowest ranking of each dimension
5. An easy to copy to GitHub summary is available
